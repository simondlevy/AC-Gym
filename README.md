This repository combines code from three sources, q.v. for details:

* Chapter 19 of Pack Publishing's
[Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On-Second-Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On-Second-Edition) 

* Scott Fujimoto's [TD3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwU9SqO0udU)

* Max Lapan's [ptan](https://github.com/Shmuma/ptan)

My goal with this repository is to bring all these algorithms together in a single place, with a simple, uniform
command-line interface and minimal external dependencies.
